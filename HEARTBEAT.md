# Heartbeat Checklist

Check these (rotate, 2-4 times per day):

1. **Calendar** — Any events in next 2 hours? Upcoming tomorrow?
2. **Apple Reminders** — Overdue or due-today items?
3. **Weather** — Significant changes for today/tomorrow?
4. **GitHub** — Open PRs, CI failures, review requests for dsmithnh3?
5. **Memory maintenance** — Review recent daily logs, update MEMORY.md if needed
